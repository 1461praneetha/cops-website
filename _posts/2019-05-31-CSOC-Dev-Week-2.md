Hello and welcome to the week 2 of CSOC Dev. Hope all of you liked messing around with branches and stuff.
Anyone tried making their [Octocat](https://myoctocat.com/build-your-octocat/) yet? :D.
This week will cover basic web frontend development using the fundamentals of fundamentals - HTML!

# What is HTML?
No, it's not a programming language first of all. Don't even plan to write it in your CV as such :D. It's a markup language
to structure your document and it's not constrained to just be linear.
That's what [hypertext](https://www.w3.org/WhatIs.html) means in the full form of HTML - Hypertext Markup Language.

# Can you be more practical?
Okay, let's start with practical stuff! To make any good-looking site of yours, which you want to admire and fawn over, you absolutely
need three things - HTML, CSS and JS. Any frontend developer requires these three masterpieces.

Now, when you get started to learn from internet, there are millions of resources to learn from. Let's filter out some to learn only
relevant stuff, not how to make your webpage run on old Netscape Navigator :D.
First, learn anything which concerns with HTML5, CSS3 and JS (ES 5+). Those aren't the latest, specially the JS has undergone lots of changes in ES6 specs.

Simplest site to learn basics of web dev is no doubt w3schools. So, get started on [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp) and [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp) from there.
For CSS, don't get lost there. Just learn syntax, how to use it and then keep the following references handy:
- [HTML references](https://htmlreference.io/)
- [CSS references](https://cssreference.io/)
- When you don't understand something in CSS, remember to search here: https://css-tricks.com/
- https://stackoverflow.com/ :D

For JS, it's very, very vast. Start with this crash course first: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics

And to practice using with your HTML page, read DOM Manipulation: https://www.sitepoint.com/dom-manipulation-vanilla-javascript-no-jquery/

# No assignment?
Sorry, but there's another assignment. And this one should really get your creative juices flowing.
Make any website you want with the things you learn and just earn points depending on the features you implement on your own!
Since you are expert in Github, here's the repo to submit your PR: https://github.com/COPS-IITBHU/CSOC-dev-week2
Just make sure to read its README and follow the given instructions.

Top developers will get special mention and goodies! So, get started on collecting your points!

For any doubts (which you can't clear from Google search :P), head over to Slack and Telegram group and ask away!
